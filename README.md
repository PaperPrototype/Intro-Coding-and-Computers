Week 0
- coding is instructions for a computer
- psuedo code for video game physics (gravity)
- coding in scratch
    - say hello 3 times
    - functions (hello x times)
- simulating gravity physics
    - movement over time
    - velocity and variables
    - applying velocity

- algorithm for searching?
- linear search
- pseudo code for linear search
- divide and conquer search (binary search)
- pseudo code for divide and conquer
- Graphing algorithm work O(n)?
- Work vs memory speed? (Memory is the slowest factor in speed -> TODO come back to later once memory is explained aka arrays)

Week 1
- 

Week 2
- Memory
- Arrays
- Memory is slow vs Number of steps, aka pointers are slow, arrays are fast

Week 0
- coding is instructions for a computer
- algrotihms, phone book, divide and conquer
- pseudo instructions (aka code) for searching
- algrorithms, solutions to problems -> searching -> very precise specific no ambiguity
    - linear search
    - Divide and conquer
    - efficiency -> game developers -> performance -> N -> 0(N)

- coding in scratch, writing instructions
    - simulating gravity with instructions
    - simulating physics with instructions
    - variables
    - functions
    - loops

Week 1
- compilers "compile" convert text into binary instructions
- binary + hexadecimal + rgb
- ASCII, -> Unicode
- pictures
- videos
- music?
- .png .excel .word .jpeg .gif etc etc because so many formats that people have made for how to represent data
- your first text language C
- compilers require syntax
    - english language needs syntax
    - take away all the paranthesis what is a function? which is a variable?
    - use parenthesis, keywords (aka void) usualluy means a function
- print
- variables
- functions
- command line
    - text instructions to a program
    - compile c
    - run c
    - make a folder
    - change directory (move through folders)
- getting input?

Week 2
