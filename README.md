# Intro to Coding and Computers
An intro to coding and how computers work

For beginners and intermediate programmers seeking a deeper understanding of how computers work as well as how to code, AKA Computer Science!

If you have ANY issues or something doesn't make sense we would LOVE IT if you told us here https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-to-Coding/issues/new

THIS COURSE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I will remove this message once it is finished. Feel free to add to the tutorials. 

Currently only week part 0 to part 3 are done.

# Navigation
1. Open the folder called "Week 0 - Fundamentals" (On mobile you have to click "View code").
2. In that folder you will find a folders called "Lecture" open that.
3. Then you will see a file named "english.md" click that to read the lecture.

- Notes can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the week folder (eg. "Week 0 - Fundamentals")
- Tutorials can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the week folder (eg. "Week 0 - Fundamentals").
    - Tutorials show you how to use the knowledge you learned in a cool project of your choice.

This process is the same for every week.

# Layout IDEAS (Random notes for indstructor DON'T read this)
Course layout idea 2
Week 0
- coding is instructions for a computer
- psuedo code for video game physics (gravity)
- coding in scratch
    - say hello 3 times
    - functions (hello x times)
- simulating gravity physics
    - movement over time
    - velocity and variables
    - applying velocity

- algorithm for searching?
- linear search
- pseudo code for linear search
- divide and conquer search (binary search)
- pseudo code for divide and conquer
- Graphing algorithm work O(n)?
- Work vs memory speed? (Memory is the slowest factor in speed -> TODO come back to later once memory is explained aka arrays)


Week 1
- compilers "compile" convert text into binary instructions
- binary + hexadecimal + rgb
- ASCII, -> Unicode
- pictures
- videos
- music?
- .png .excel .word .jpeg .gif etc etc because so many formats that people have made for how to represent data
- your first text language C
- compilers require syntax
    - english language needs syntax
    - take away all the paranthesis what is a function? which is a variable?
    - use parenthesis, keywords (aka void) usualluy means a function
- print
- variables
- functions
- command line
    - text instructions to a program
    - compile c
    - run c
    - make a folder
    - change directory (move through folders)
- getting input?


Week 2
- Memory
- Arrays
- Memory is slow vs Number of steps, aka pointers are slow, arrays are fast
- 


Topics covered
- none

Topics that need covered
- functions
- variables
- parameters (variables for functions)
- gravity with code
- search algorithms
- linear search
- binary search
- C
- algorithms O(n)
- memory
- pointers
- arrays
- git
- hash tables
- dictionaries
- compression
- installing a C compiler on mac / linux / windows
