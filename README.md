# Intro to Coding and Computers
UPDATE: this course is no longer under development. I strongly recommend Harvards (free) Introduction to Computer Science course https://www.edx.org/cs50 instead. If your interested only sections 0 to 8 are complete.

REASON: after teaching this course for 6 months to a group of students, I realized it was fundamentally too fast-paced for beginners. It was also an exhausting endeaver. I madde the mistake of jumping into advanced topics really quickly.

# LEGACY
## Who is this course for?
For beginners and intermediate programmers seeking a deeper understanding of how computers work as well as how to code, AKA Computer Science!

## Navigation
1. Open the folder called "00 - Python" (On mobile you have to click "view code").
2. In that folder you will find a file called "english.md" open that, click that to read the lecture.

- Notes can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the section folder (eg. "00 - Python" is a section folder)
- Tutorials can be found in a folder called "Tutorials" under the section folder (eg. "01 - Jumpy Game" is a section folder).
    - Tutorials show you how to use the knowledge you learned in a cool project of your choice.

This process is the same for every week.
