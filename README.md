# Intro to Coding and Computers
An intro to coding and how computers work

For beginners and intermediate programmers seeking a deeper understanding of how computers work as well as how to code, AKA Computer Science!

If you have ANY issues or something doesn't make sense we would LOVE IT if you told us here -> https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-to-Coding/issues/new

THIS COURSE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I will remove this message once it is finished. Feel free to add to the tutorials. 

# Navigation
1. Open the folder called "00 - Python" (On mobile you have to click "view code").
2. In that folder you will find a folder called "Lecture" open that.
3. Then you will see a file named "english.md" click that to read the lecture.

- Notes can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the section folder (eg. "00 - Python" is a section folder)
- Tutorials can be found in a folder called "Tutorials" under the section folder (eg. "01 - Jumpy Game" is a section folder).
    - Tutorials show you how to use the knowledge you learned in a cool project of your choice.

This process is the same for every week.

TODO:
interpreter vs compiler - in fundamentals section
dynamically linked vs statically linked (at compile time) - 

Layout IDEAS: (ignore this)
0 Python
	- Select and drag to CP/Paste gif
1 Fundamentals
2 C
3 Shell + Compiling
4 Arrays + Addresses
5 Input
6 Searching + Algorithms
	tutorials: binary search
7 Memory
	- structs
	- custom types
	- Stack vs heap
	- malloc
	- free
	- valgrind
8 Lists
	- queue list (linked list)
	- Linked list (explantion only, don't make them do it, only have them do queue Linked List)
	- if statements + branch prediction (use pictures so don't fall asleep + make explanation short)
	- Array list (vec)
9 Sort
	- swap.c
	- recursion
	- simplest sort method
10 Setup
	- download vs code
	- download C extension
	- download package manager
		- use brew install "clang"
		- use brew install "make"
	- Make hello world program
11 GitHub
	- publish hello world program to github
12 Spellchecker
	- file handling
	- dict/hash table
	- benchmark using timed
13 Fastest Spellchecker
	- tree (using array)
	- memory locality
