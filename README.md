THIS COURSE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I will remove this message once it is finished. Feel free to add to the tutorials. 

# Navigation
1. Open the folder called "00 - Python" (On mobile you have to click "view code").
2. In that folder you will find a folder called "Lecture" open that.
3. Then you will see a file named "english.md" click that to read the lecture.

- Notes can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the section folder (eg. "00 - Python" is a section folder)
- Tutorials can be found in a folder called "Tutorials" under the section folder (eg. "01 - Pyxel" is a section folder).
    - Tutorials show you how to use the knowledge you learned in a cool project of your choice.

This process is the same for every week.
