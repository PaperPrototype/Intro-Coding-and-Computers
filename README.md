# Intro to Coding and Computers
UPDATE: this course is no longer under development. If you are a complete beginner (never made aything except hellow world) I strongly recommend Khan academy's 

Only sections 0 to 8 are complete. Since I only had 1 week to write each lecture there is a lot of bad spelling, since some sections are over 500 lines of text + many marked up diagrams + [notes](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/blob/main/03%20-%20C%20%2B%20Debugging/Notes/english.md) on new grammer and concepts explained in each section, as well as quite a few [tutorials to practice what was learned in each section](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/tree/main/03%20-%20C%20%2B%20Debugging/Tutorials), and, even [re-writing](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/tree/main/02%20-%20Fundamentals/Archive) sections [up to 2 times](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/tree/main/00%20-%20Python/Archive)

REASON: I spent 6 months teaching this course to a group of 4 teenagers. After teaching this course for 6 months to a group of students, I realized it was fundamentally too fast-paced for beginners, and I jumped into advanced topics really quickly, they did not enjoy it (each section can take over 2 hours to complete, since I attempted to cover what a 2 hour college lecture would). Instead I should have showed them the fun side of programming before nailing them down with concepts like [pointers and arrays](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/blob/main/05%20-%20Arrays%20%2B%20Addresses/english.md), [heap vs stack memory](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/blob/main/08%20-%20Stack%20%2B%20Heap/Lecture/english.md), [binary number representation](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Intro-Coding-and-Computers/blob/main/02%20-%20Fundamentals/english.md), and [using the shell to compile C code]().

If you are an intermediate programmer (got past hello world), and you want to be as good as a software developer, then I strongly (very strongly) recommend Harvards (free) Introduction to Computer Science course https://www.edx.org/cs50, which I based this course on. It will teach you what I attempted to teach, but do a much better job than me.

> It was also an exhausting endeaver

# LEGACY
## Who is this course for?
For beginners and intermediate programmers seeking a deeper understanding of how computers work as well as how to code, AKA Computer Science!

## Navigation
1. Open the folder called "00 - Python" (On mobile you have to click "view code").
2. In that folder you will find a file called "english.md" open that, click that to read the lecture.

- Notes can be found in a folder called "Notes" under the section folder (eg. "00 - Python" is a section folder)
- Tutorials can be found in a folder called "Tutorials" under the section folder (eg. "01 - Jumpy Game" is a section folder).
    - Tutorials show you how to use the knowledge you learned in a cool project of your choice.

This process is the same for every week.
