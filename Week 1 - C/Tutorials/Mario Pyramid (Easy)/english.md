print hashes in the terminal to make a pyramid.

![] show picture of mario's pyramid

We could do this manually.

```
show manual code

print("   # \n");
print("  ## \n");
print(" ### \n");
print("#### \n");
```

but we can use a for loop!

```
![] TODO explain?

```

LATER:
this for loop lets us print a pyrmaid of any height!
