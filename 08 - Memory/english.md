Variables (addresses) on the stack don't need to hold an address.

Variables that are an address

Pointers (already covered in week 2)

Defining custom types and structures

Dynamic memory allocation

Call stack

"swap.c"
- function parameters are a **copy** of the variable
- to get a reference we need to use an address to the data (a pointer)
