Stack vs Heap

- Stack is copies of stuff (always)

- "swap.c"
	- function parameters are a **copy** of the variable
	- to get a reference we need to use an address to the data (a pointer) <- will need to know for "sorting algorithms"

- Call stack
	- calling a function inside of itself

Variables that are an address
	- Pointers (already covered in week 2)
