You just finished learning about the basics of coding. Now you get to actually *do* something with that coding!

We are going to use a "framework" or "library" of code (written by someone else) that was made for making games using Python.

Make a new Repl and select "PyGame". Name it "Pygame".

We need to get access to the "PyGame" framework in our code. 

(add the following code)
```py
import pygame

```
