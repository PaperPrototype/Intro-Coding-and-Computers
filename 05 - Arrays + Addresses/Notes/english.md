Memory Address
> "Most modern computers are byte-addressable. Each address identifies a single byte (eight bits) of storage. Data larger than a single byte may be stored in a sequence of consecutive addresses" (AKA arrays) -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address#Unit_of_address_resolution)
