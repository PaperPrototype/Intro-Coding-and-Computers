Now you know how to code, the possibilities of what you can learn and ***do*** are now endless!!!

Some cool languages you might want to check out are:
- Go
- Rust
- Zig
- Java
- C# (like Java, except more modern)
- Lua

There are many, many, programming languages. Java (was) very big, and it is still used for the Java edition of Minecraft!

Most likely you'll want to learn how your favorite game was made. In that case a "Game Engine" is most likely what was used, like: 
- Unity (C#) (Intro to Unity <- course coming soon!)
- Unreal Engine (C++)
- Roblox Studio (Lua) (considering a course)
- Godot (GD script)
- The Machinery (C) (Intro to The Machinery <- planned course!)

And sometimes (like is the case with Minecraft) it was made using plain old code.

If you are super hyped and want to make a game from scratch, without using a game engine, or even want to make your own game engine, then...

I plan on making a course on making a simple game engine. Mainly getting 3D "stuff" on a @D flat screen and how all that works.

For now I recommend you go the path of using a game engine, since making your own/making a game uisn gpure code takes an insane amount of time (compared to using a game engine). 

Since I haven't any courses on Unity, or Roblox Studio, or The Macinery (a new game engine) I recommend the following courses made by GameDev.tv to get you started

- Unity
	- make 2D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/
	- make 3D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/

- Unreal Engine
	- make 3D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/
		- multiplayer games https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/

I own all the above recommended courses. Although I have only finished part of the Unity courses.

Since you already have strong foundation in C, a simple intruduction to Unity is all you need to make some games. C# is considerably easier than C, and Unity is not that difficult to learn. Although the above Unity courses will teach you "how to use Unity", they won't teach you *how Unity works*, which is what I strugled with the most, and I found frustrating because once I understood how Unity worked it became really easy to know how to use it to make the game what I wanted.

On a side note, Unreal Engine is definitely harder to learn since you have to use C++ for programming, but you know C and C++ is basically C with a butt ton more features.
