Memory Address
> "Most modern computers are byte-addressable. Each address identifies a single byte (eight bits) of storage. Data larger than a single byte may be stored in a sequence of consecutive addresses" (aka arrays)
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address#Unit_of_address_resolution

Arrays
> Continous blocks of memory
> The first element in an array is stored in a variable as a memory address (called a "pointer" in C).

Void
> A pointer to an unkown type https://www.c-programming-simple-steps.com/what-is-void.html
