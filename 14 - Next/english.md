Now you know how to code, the possibilities of what you can learn and ***do*** are now endless!!!

Some cool languages you might want to check out are:
- Go
- Rust
- Zig
- Java
- C# (like Java, except more modern)
- Lua

There are many, many, programming languages. Java was very big, and it is still used for the Java edition of Minecraft.

Most likely you'll want to learn how your favorite game was made. 

It is likely your favorite game was made with a "game engine" like: 
- Unity (C#) (Intro to Unity <- planned course!)
- Unreal Engine (C++)
- Roblox Studio (Lua)
- Godot (GD script)
- The Machinery (C) (Intro to The Machinery <- planned course!)

And sometimes even a custom made engine! Companies have been made simply from a group of people getting together and making an engine that was unlike other engines, and had advantages that made people want to use their engine over other ones!

Maybe your super hyped and you want to make your own game engine (like me)!

I plan on making a course on making a simple game engine. Mainly getting 3D "stuff" on a screen, and how you can "rotate" stuff + some physics.

For now I recommend the following courses

- Unity
	- make 2D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/
	- make 3D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/

- Unreal Engine
	- make 3D games https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/
		- multiplayer games https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/

I own all the above recommended courses. Although I have only finished part of the Unity courses.

Since you already have strong foundation in C, a simple intruduction to Unity is all you need to make some games. C# is considerable easier than C, and Unity is not that difficult to learn. Although the above Unity courses will teach you "how to use Unity", and not *how Unity works*, which I found frustrating cause Unity is actually pretty simple to use once you know how it works.

On a side note, Unreal Engine is probably harder to learn since you have to use C++ for programming.
