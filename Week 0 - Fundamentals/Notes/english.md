# Fundamentals
Program
> A file of binary instructions for the computers processor. A program is also called an app.

Syntax
> A specific way of writing something so that an interpreter or compiler can understand it. 
> In English we also have syntax, if I just said "nwernwernwe )28m 23 qr1" You would have no idea what I was trying to say! In the same way programming language have syntax so that the compiler or interpreter can understand it.

Programming Language
> A text based programming "language" with syntax rules, that gets either "interpreted" by an interpreter program or gets "compiled" into 0s and 1s by a compiler.

Compiler
> A program that takes text based instructions from a text file, and converts them into binary instructions for you.

Interpreter
> A program that reads through a text file and figures out what instructions we are writing it reads them.

Python (programming language)
> An interpreted programming language, the files for it end with .py

Binary
> Information in the form of 0s and 1s.

Code
> Human readable text instructions for a computer, in a text file.

Hexadecimal
> A number system with a base of 16.

ASCII
> A mapping (aka encoding) of numbers to the symbols they represent.
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)

Bit
> A single positive or negative electric charge, represented by a `1` or a `0`.

Byte
> A set of 8 bits. Every computer stores bits in sets of 8.

Unicode
> A universal mapping (aka encoding) of numbers to the symbols they represent. The first 256 numbers map in the same way as ASCII.

UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
> Unicode Transform Format

Text
> A file of "text" is a file containing Unicode or ASCII characters.

"Bug"
> When a programming language's instructions fail due to the “programmer” not expecting a possibility that causes the code to stop working correctly.
> Origins of the the term "bug"
> https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3758/bug

"Debugging"
> Working to remove "bugs" (programmer errors) from code.

Algorithm
> A way of solving a problem through a specific set of steps

Input
> Information (aka list of contacts) you give to some code for it to work on

Output
> Information (aka a contact) that code has worked on that the code gives back to you.

# Coding Jargon
Text editor
> Like Google Docs, it helps you write your code and automatically edits code for you, so that the computer can understand it.

IDE (Integrated Developer Environment)
> A software (aka app) that has a text editor (Loke google docs), and a file viewer for viewing files.

Variables
> A code-word we use to refer to some value. `a = 12` then `a + 2 = 14`

Function
> A group of code that you can refer to using a name.
> Also a group of code that does something with an input. Sometimes functions can give you an output.

Calling a function
> Refering to a function, giving it the input it needs, and then having the code inside of it run ("run" just means the code was "processed" by the processor).

Loop
> Code that goes in a circle, doing the same thing over and over (sometimes doing "looping" over every item in a list).
