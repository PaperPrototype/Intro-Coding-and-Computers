To make a course for complete beginners to learn how computers really work.

I tried my best to adhere to the guidelines layed out in the [course guidebook](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook)

One notable guideline that helped a lot was [detail_guideline_013](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook/blob/main/Guides/Details/english.md#detail_guideline_013) It's titled "Don't name it till you've explained it". This helped me make explanations less painful for people who aren't familiar with the Jargon. Lol, I even managed to explain functions and variables without using the word function or variable initially.

This course is very low level. It teaches you everything as you use it. We don't tell you to "trust us". We just show you the "Why". This leads to an intense amount of information but also a very good understanding of how everything works.

I also had to be conscious about not Over Explaining simple concepts. Like Big O Notation. THe original explanation was... hard to read and long. After the suffering of onw of my in person students I reduced the explanation to a few paragraphs.

I also focus more on getting the IDE and tooling set up on yur own computer than most CS courses, since I found that I had to figure this out myself (and it took awhile). This will also help with future courses that use C (aka "Intro to Plugins for OurMachinery").

Note to Contributers.
- If you are going to add a topic to the course, don't just throw it in there and then never talk about it again. Make sure to incorporate it with the rest of the course.

- Also, if you are making a course wide change make it a pull request, so that it can be reviewed.
