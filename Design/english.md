To make a course for complete beginners to learn how computers really work.

I tried my best to adhere to the guidelines layed out in the [course guidebook](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook)

One notable guideline that helped a lot was [detail_guideline_013](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook/blob/main/Guides/Details/english.md#detail_guideline_013) It's titled "Don't name it till you've explained it". THis helped me make explanations less painful for people who aren't familiar with the Jargon. Lol, I even managed to explain functions and variables without using the word function or variable initially.
