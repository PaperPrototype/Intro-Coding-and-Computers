The first iterationo fthe course was a disaster (for some stufdetns). Every explanation went into extreme detail (and were very thorough), some of them were completely incorrect as well. I am forever indebted to the students who suffered through those first lectures (thank you, and I am truly sorry). I have since re-written them and made them as short as possible.

My other mistake was to cram multiple subjests into one lecture. THe reasoning was that you would have a week to read it, which was, to say the least, not what heppened, instead most students tried to read it in one day. I have now separated each subject into Day long readable lectrues.

(THis was written very quickly as I was on a time crucnh).
