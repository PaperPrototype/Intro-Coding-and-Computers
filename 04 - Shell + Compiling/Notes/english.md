Interpreter
- a program that reads through text-based-code and interprets it and "does" what the code says.

Compiler
- a program that converts text-based-code into assembly instructions for a processor.
- compilers explained well https://www.calleluks.com/the-four-stages-of-compiling-a-c-program/

Assembler
- a program that takes text readable assembly instructions and converts it into 0s and 1s assembly, called "machine code".

Linker
- a program that takes our written machine code (0s and 1s assembly) and combines it with some other persons machine code.

Assembly
- text based version of machine code (0s and 1s) instructions

Machine Code
- 0s and 1s CPU instructions + data (variables, functions)

CLI
- Command Line Interface

Command Line Argument
- Any words/input typed into a CLI after the name of a program `./main`
- Example: `./main hello world!`  ”hello” and “world” are arguments

## CLI stuff
Compile command: `make myProgram`
Run command: `./myProgram`

Change Directory: `cd`

Clear shell: `ctrl` + `L`

Cancel (Stop) program: `ctrl` + `C`

## How the Shell works
A thorough and deep explanation of a Shell (kind of advanced)

# Compilers
Make
> A program that automically takes care of running a compiler with the rename command (it also takes care of linking).

Compiling
> The process of converting a text based programming language into binary instructions using a Compiler.

Clang
> A compiler for the C family of programming languages C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++.
