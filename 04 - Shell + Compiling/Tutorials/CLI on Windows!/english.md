Use windows search and open the app called "Command Prompt".

Some Windows commands are different than Unix (Linux or Mac) commands.

To "list" the files in your current folder use the `dir` command

(command)
```
dir
```

To display the current directory you are in use the `cd` command (different from `cd` on Replit (Replit uses Linux in the background))

(command)
```
cd
```
